## Without Hot Water

*Without Hot Water* was a set of ideas put to paper sometime in 2007 when the boiler for the apartment building I lived in went down. I let it languish, sort-of-half-finished until now. Cleaned up and a bit more coherent, it's still a simple jazzy thing for piano, but now I have hot water.
