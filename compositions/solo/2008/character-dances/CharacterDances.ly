        These Character Dances are intended to be small portraits of a few of the
        people in my life.  The set stands as something of a diary of my
        relationships through the years and how they've changed me as well as the
        others involved.  I invite you to play any number of these pieces you want
        in any order you desire.

        With the \italic{sostenuto} pedal being held down for each phrase, all of the
        notes played should be ringing at the end of the phrase, so take the dynamic
        markings to heart in order for this to be heard. Don't be afraid to go slow
        enough so that your fingers don't get tripped up in measures 9 and 11.

        The left hand only ever plays the notes \italic{b} and \italic{g}, so feel
        free to let it sit down low and out of the way for the right-hand's melodies.
        As with the first piece, the sustained notes should create a decaying chord
        that changes texture as time goes on.

        Aleatoricism figured large in the composition of this piece, so timing should
        be taken freely, however the performer desires.  In general, however, events
        in the separate hands should take place where they occur visually (i.e.:
        notes in the left hand below notes in the right hand should occur at roughly
        the same time).

        This piece takes sixteen bars to modulate one half-step.  There is not much
        to be said for its performance, other than trying to make that as clear as
        possible to the audience.

        As this piece gets higher and faster, it is important to reach a sort of
        emotional frisson without getting too loud, with the tension resolved in the
        final three measures.
